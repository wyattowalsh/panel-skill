# Security Policy

## Scope

panel-skill is a pure markdown skill that contains no executable code. Security
considerations are limited to:

1. **Prompt injection**: Malicious topic inputs designed to manipulate panel behavior
2. **Information disclosure**: Expert personas accidentally revealing sensitive patterns
3. **Dependency security**: GitHub Actions workflow dependencies

1. **Do NOT** open a public issue
2. Email [security contact] with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce

   - Suggested fix (if any)

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and provide a detailed response
within 7 days.

## Security Considerations for Users
