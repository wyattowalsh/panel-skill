# Panel Output Quality Checklist

Use this checklist to validate panel discussion outputs after making changes
to panel-debate-skill.

---

## Pre-Discussion Validation

- [ ] **Complexity assessed**: Topic scored on 5-15 scale
- [ ] **Appropriate action**: Low complexity rejected, medium/high proceeds
- [ ] **Diversity score calculated**: Must be ≥60
- [ ] **All required archetypes**: Contrarian, Synthesizer, Specialist present
- [ ] **No archetype dominance**: No archetype exceeds 30% of panel

---

## Expert Generation

- [ ] **Realistic names**: Diverse, authentic-sounding names
- [ ] **Distinct backgrounds**: Each expert has unique expertise
- [ ] **Clear roles**: Job title and domain clearly stated
- [ ] **Communication styles**: Distinguishable speaking patterns
- [ ] **Relevant concerns**: Typical concerns match their expertise

---

## Discussion Flow

### Opening Statements
- [ ] **All experts speak**: Each expert establishes position
- [ ] **3-5 sentences each**: Appropriate length
- [ ] **Distinct positions**: Not just agreeing with each other

### Cross-Examination
- [ ] **Natural flow**: Responses feel conversational
- [ ] **Building and challenging**: Mix of agreement and disagreement
- [ ] **Relevance-based speaking**: Experts speak on their domains
- [ ] **Moderator balance**: Quiet experts prompted

### Contrarian Protection
- [ ] **Invited before synthesis**: "What are we missing?"
- [ ] **Substantive challenges**: Evidence-based, not mere opposition
- [ ] **Minority preserved**: Dissenting views not dismissed
- [ ] **Pre-mortem (high complexity)**: Failure scenarios explored

---

## Per-Round Synthesis

- [ ] **Agreements identified**: Clear consensus points listed
- [ ] **Tensions surfaced**: Unresolved disagreements explicit
- [ ] **Open questions**: Unknowns with resolution paths
- [ ] **Emerging insights**: Novel understanding from exchange
- [ ] **At least one tension**: If zero, contrarian challenge invoked

---

## Final Report

### Structure
- [ ] **Executive summary**: 1-2 sentences, high-level outcome
- [ ] **Consensus points**: Numbered, with evolution of thinking
- [ ] **Trade-offs**: Each gets subsection with recommendation
- [ ] **Actionable recommendations**: Grouped by timeframe
- [ ] **Dissenting views**: Direct quotes from disagreeing experts
- [ ] **Open questions**: Unresolved topics for future

### Quality
- [ ] **Actionable**: Specific next steps, not observations
- [ ] **Nuanced**: Caveats and boundary conditions included
- [ ] **Not wishy-washy**: "It depends" specifies on what
- [ ] **Acknowledges uncertainty**: Appropriate confidence levels
- [ ] **Shows emergence**: Insights beyond individual statements
- [ ] **Respects expertise**: Domain-specific insights weighted
- [ ] **Directly answers**: Actually addresses original question

---

## Confidence-Weighted Synthesis

- [ ] **Confidence signals present**: High/medium/low indicated
- [ ] **Domain relevance weighted**: Core vs adjacent vs outside
- [ ] **Weighted positions**: Not simple majority voting
- [ ] **Expert disagreements**: Preserved with reasoning

---

## Output Formatting

- [ ] **Panel header**: Rounded corners, expert list
- [ ] **Speaker turns**: 🎤 icon, name (role), quoted content
- [ ] **Cross-talk**: "responding to", "building on" phrases
- [ ] **Synthesis blocks**: 📋 icon, categorized bullets
- [ ] **Final report**: Double-line box, clear sections
- [ ] **Unicode renders**: Box characters display correctly

---

## Anti-Pattern Detection

The following should NOT appear:

- [ ] Echo chamber (all experts agree immediately)
- [ ] Vague integration ("both have good points")
- [ ] Premature consensus (Round 1 full agreement)
- [ ] Wishy-washy ("it depends on your situation")
- [ ] Abstraction without grounding ("holistic approach")
- [ ] Expertise mismatch (wrong expert on topic)
- [ ] Conformity cascade (majority drowns out dissent)
